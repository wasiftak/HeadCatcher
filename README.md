# 🎮 Face Pong: The AI-Powered Arcade Game

Face Pong is an interactive arcade game built with Python and OpenCV that reimagines classic paddle-and-ball gameplay. The core feature is its hands-free control system, which uses a Haar Cascade classifier to detect the player's face in real-time via webcam. The horizontal position of the face is then smoothly mapped to the on-screen paddle, allowing for intuitive, motion-based control.

The project goes beyond a simple tech demo, incorporating a complete game loop with progressively challenging levels, a dynamic physics engine for angled bounces, and a random power-up system to ensure a unique experience every time you play.

## ✨ Features
✅ **Real-Time Face Control**: Uses OpenCV to track your face and move the paddle smoothly and responsively.  
✅ **Intelligent Physics**: The ball's bounce angle changes based on where it hits the paddle, allowing for skillful shots.  
✅ **Dynamic Progression**: The game gets faster and more challenging as you advance through levels.  
✅ **Power-Ups & Penalties**: Catch falling icons with your paddle to get advantages like a wider paddle or an extra life. But watch out for penalties that can shrink your paddle or speed up the ball!  
✅ **Complete Game Loop**: Includes a scoring system, lives, and a 'Game Over' screen with a restart option.  
✅ **Polished Visuals**: Features a 3D-style ball, a sleek gradient paddle, and a clean UI with outlined text for perfect readability.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Python 3 🐍**  
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: Used for all computer vision tasks (real-time face detection) and for creating the game window and drawing all the shapes and images.  
- **NumPy**: Used for fast numerical calculations, primarily by OpenCV behind the scenes.

## 🚀 Getting Started
Getting the game running on your machine is simple.

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wasiftak/dx-ball.git
```

### 2️⃣ Set up a Python environment:
A virtual environment or Conda is highly recommended to keep dependencies clean.

```bash
# Example using venv
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3️⃣ Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

### 4️⃣ Run the game! 🎉
```bash
python main.py
```

## 🕹️ How to Play
- Move your head left and right to control the paddle.  
- Hit the ball to score points. The level increases after every 5 paddle hits.  
- Catch falling icons with your paddle to get power-ups (or penalties!).  
- Don't let the ball fall past your paddle, or you'll lose a life.  
- Press **'R'** to restart when the game is over.  
- Press **'Q'** to quit at any time.
